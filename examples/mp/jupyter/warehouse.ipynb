    "# The Warehouse Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Warehouse Problem is a well-know optimization case found in many textbooks.\n",
    "The problem consists, given a set of candidate warehouse *locations* and a set of *stores*\n",
    "to decide which warehouse to open and which warehouse will server which store.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is provided as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each warehouse, we require a tuple (name, capacity, fixed-cost), where _name_ is the unique name of the warehouse, _capacity_ is the maximum number of stores it can supply and _fixed_cost_ is the cost incurred by opening the warehouse.\n",
    "* For each couple (warehouse, store) a _supply_cost_ which estimates the cost of supplying this store by this warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compact way of representing the data is a Python _dictionary_: for each warehouse tuple, list all supply costs for all stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem consists in deciding which warehouse will be open and for each store, by which warehouse it will be supplied.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Decisions must satisfy the following (simplified) business constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unicity: each store is supplied by one unique warehouse\n",
    "2. A store can only be supplied by an _open_ warehouse\n",
    "3. Capacity: the number of stores supplied by a warehouse must be less than its capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to minimize the total cost incurred by the decisions, which is made of two costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The *Total Opening Cost* is the sum of opening costs ranging over all open warehouses.\n",
    "* The *Total Supply Cost* is the sum of supply costs for all the chosen (warehouse, store) pairs\n"
